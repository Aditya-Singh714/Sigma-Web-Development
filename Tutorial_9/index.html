    <h1>Id and Classes</h1>
    <!-- An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one HTML element within a page. It is often used for unique styling and JavaScript manipulation -->

    <!-- The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements. Thar way, you can easily change their look or behaviour all at once. Classes are not unique and can be assigned to multiple elements. They are generally used for applying the same styles or behaviour to a group of elements. -->
